A bodega cat is a cat that inhabits a bodega, which in New York City English refers to a convenience store or deli.
A bodega cat may be a domesticated cat that is kept by the bodega owner,
or a semi-feral cat that the bodega owner attracts to the store through regular feeding.
Public health departments typically prohibit bodega cats under food codes
that ban live animals from establishments where consumable goods are sold.
