A crayon (or wax pastel) is a stick of pigmented wax used for writing or drawing.
Wax crayons differ from pastels, in which the pigment is mixed with a dry binder such as gum arabic,
and from oil pastels, where the binder is a mixture of wax and oil.
Crayons are available at a range of prices and are easy to work with.
They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt, typically non-toxic,
and available in a wide variety of colors.
These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw
in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists.
